# Sublime Text Plugin: Paste with Replace

A simple Sublime Text plugin that prompts for 2 string values, then pastes
whatever's on the pasteboard with the first string replaced by the second.
It has some smarts: if the found text is in ALL CAPS / all lower / Title Case,
the replacement will be formatted the same way.

The default key bindings are Cmd+Alt+V (Mac) and Ctrl+Alt+V (Windows / Linux).
